# â€œProductivity is commonly defined as a ratio between the output volume and the volume of inputs.

# Measures how efficiently production inputs are being used in an economy to produce a given level of output.

# Labour and capital inputs

# Identify and target industries with low productivity levels


# Example of initiatives within other nations to increase local productivity

# Main business question is generally: How can we improve productivity within Scotland and the UK overall?
 

# What factors can be improved to increase employee and/or business productivity across UK regions?



# Which industries are lagging behind in terms of productivity and how could they catch up?



# Can we predict overall UK productivity rates?
