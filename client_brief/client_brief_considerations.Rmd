## Initial comments
• Data is extensive and unwieldy
• Data comes in spreadsheets and is not formatted well and will require heavy cleaning

## Initial assessment
• Amount of data cleaning could be reduced by targeting attention to key areas of interest
• Keep in mind the accuracy of the data
• 

## Questions to answer
• Are there other, cleaner, sources of the same data
• How much of it is required to get started with initial exploration
• How much of it is required for indepth analysis
• Has the client oversimplified the problem in any way - e.g. part-employment, zero-hour contracts etc.
• What has been the effect of changing sector dominance in UK
• How about Scotland specifically
• What are the effects of inflation, technological progress and economic crises
• Uncertainty and crises / Brexit
• Balance sheets, pensions, costs
• Regulation
• Investment in people, staff, technology and new methods
• Communication - broadband, Corona
• Incentivisation
• Corona
• Rents and key workers
• Benefits system
• UK economic balance versus others




# Initial thoughts
• Careful planning might save some time
• Explanatory versus predictive models
• Is low productivity a natural course of events for developed countries?
# Focus on MVP
Compartmentalise
